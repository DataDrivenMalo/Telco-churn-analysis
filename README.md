**Telco Churn Analysis**
This project explores customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company. The goal is to identify patterns and key factors driving customer attrition and to build machine learning models that predict churn effectively.

**Project Overview**
Customer churn poses a significant challenge to subscription-based businesses. In this project, I:
1.Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
2.Handled missing values and class imbalance.
3.Applied encoding techniques for categorical features.
4.Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict churn.

**Machine Learning Models Used**
1.Logistic Regression
2.Random Forest Classifier

Each model was evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1 Score
ROC AUC
Confusion Matrix
Cross-Validation

**Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Git / GitHub

**Files**
Telco_Churn_Analysis.ipynb: Main notebook containing the full analysis and modeling process.
README.md: This file.

**Key Insights**
Tenure, Contract Type, and Monthly Charges emerged as important features.
Random Forest slightly outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of ROC AUC.

This project demonstrates my data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation skills. It's part of my data science portfolio.
